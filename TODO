//buggy, can render to texture but SDL_Destroy() will not destroy that texture so it just gobbles up VRAM
-render aaFilledPolygonRBGA to texture so I only
    need to update it when it changes size
-render aaFilledPieRBGA to texture

UI
-grey out add/remove vertex when a polygon is not selected
-small image should be a square, not stretched, size to height and cut off right side if it is too wide, maybe center

bugs
-circles stop rendering if you zoom into them too closely
-vertices sprite renders too small
